This piece of MATLAB code implements the CGHTRIMMER method. 
For a demo on the Coriell Dataset run from the command line 
demo_coriell and for a demo on Breast Cancer Data run demo_breastcancer.

The code is documented and there are several comments which indicate to 
the user for example which lines he/she should MATLAB-comment to change 
the functionality, e.g., close figures to save memory, remove plotting etc.
